excerpt: "Crystallograhic and structural analysis. Available [here](https://github.com/benjaminbritton/AstroEBSD).

- Orientation determination, signal clustering, and structure classification with template matching, built in MATLAB.â€‹

- Initially developed by the group for Hough transforms and geometrical analysis of diffraction data.

- Recently updated to version 2.0 with my contributions: an open-source PCA pipeline for analysis of correlative, multimodal datasets, including Fourier cross-correlation of simulated templates for orientation and structure ID."
