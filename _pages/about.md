I'm a scientist: Cambridge BA/MSci, Imperial College London PhD. My research focusses on using ML and deep learning to better understand (and find useful representations of) real, noisy data. 

I'm currently working as a machine learning researcher looking at time-series classification and encoding, using various flavours of neural network.

This site hosts my **CV**, a record of my **publications**, and a **blog** including demo workflows and things I find interesting.


What I do
------
- Advanced ETL for understanding **latent feature spaces** in messy, complicated, multimodal data.
- Clustering, classifying, and regressing in both supervised and unsupervised settings.
- Building **machine learning models**, for example in electron microscopy research.


How I do it
------
- Experienced with **Python** and **MATLAB** programming.
- Well versed in **data science and machine learning frameworks**: Numpy, PyTorch, SciKit-Learn, Multiprocessing, etc.
- Practiced in **software engineering techniques**, including git version control, Linux/UNIX development, etc.
- PhD experience in **ML for electron microscopy**: used to publishing papers and disseminating analyses.
