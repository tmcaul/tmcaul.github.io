I'm a **scientist**, **Cambridge grad**, and **Imperial College PhD student**, working on applying data science to microstructural characterisation methods.

This site (unashamedly) hosts my **CV**, **highlights** from my research, a record of my **publications**, and a **blog** including demo workflows and things I find interesting.

&newline

What I do:
======
- Understand **latent feature spaces** in messy, complicated, multimodal data.
- **Classifying** for feature ID, or regressing for contextual metrics.
- Building **machine learning models**, for example in electron microscopy research.

&newline

How I do it:
======
- Experienced with **Python** and **MATLAB** programming, and knowledge of **C++**.
- Well versed in **data science and machine learning frameworks**: Numpy, PyTorch, SciKit-Learn, Multiprocessing, etc.
- Practiced in **software engineering techniques**, including git version control etc.
- PhD experience in **ML for electron microscopy**: used to publishing papers and disseminating analyses.
