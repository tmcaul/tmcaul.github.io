This site (unashamedly) hosts my CV, highlights from my research, a record of my publications, and a blog including demo workflows and things I find interesting.

What I do:
======
-1. Understand latent feature spaces in messy, complicated, multimodal data.
-1. Classifying for feature ID, or regressing for contextual metrics.
-1. Building machine learning models, for example in electron microscopy research.

How I do it:
======
-1. Experienced with Python and MATLAB programming, and knowledge of C++.
-1. Well versed in data science and machine learning frameworks: Numpy, PyTorch, SciKit-Learn, Multiprocessing, etc.
-1. Practiced in software engineering techniques, including git version control etc.
-1. PhD experience in ML for electron microscopy: used to publishing papers and disseminating analyses.
