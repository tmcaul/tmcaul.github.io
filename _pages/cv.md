Education
======
* BA, MSci (1st class) in Natural Sciences, University of Cambridge, 2017
* PhD in Quantitative Electron Microscopy, Imperial College London, 2020 (expected)

Skills
======
- **Python** - Experienced with NumPy, PyTorch, Multiprocessing, SKLearn, Matplotlib, SciPy packages etc. Two software packages (ebspy, crosspy) developed and released open-source.

- **MATLAB** - Experienced with Machine Learning, Statistics, Parallel Computing toolboxes, etc. Five years’ experience. Major contributions and refactoring of AstroEBSD, a widely used software package.

- **C++** - High-performance linear algebra and fast Fourier transforms implemented, using eigen and fftw packages. Porting functions from MATLAB has resulted in significant speedups (approx. 100 times).

- **Machine learning** - Most experience with PCA, NMF, and neural networks. Unsupservised learning with SKLearn. Neural networks built with PyTorch (both with and without fastai) and MATLAB machine learning toolbox.

- **Computational linear algebra** - I routinely analyse high-dimensionality data, perform orientation analyses, and implement data basis transformations. Experienced with SVD, eigen-decompositions, least-squares solutions.

- **Software development** - Experienced with Github, VSCode, Jupyter Notebooks, etc.

- **Data handling and computation** - Experienced with clustering, factor extraction, and feature ID. Proficient with NumPy / PyTorch for vectorisation, Numba for speedup, and Multiprocessing for parallelisation.

- **Communication & teaching** - I have successfully supervised Masters students, taught undergraduate classes, and disseminated research at conferences to foster collaboration.
