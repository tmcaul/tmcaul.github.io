Education
------
- **BA, MSci** (1st class) in **Natural Sciences**, University of Cambridge, 2017
- **PhD** in **Quantitative Electron Microscopy**, Imperial College London, 2020 (expected)


Skills
------
- **Python** - Experienced with NumPy, PyTorch, Multiprocessing, SKLearn, Matplotlib, SciPy packages etc. Two software packages (ebspy, crosspy) developed and released open-source.

- **MATLAB** - Experienced with Machine Learning, Statistics, Parallel Computing toolboxes, etc. Five years’ experience. Major contributions and refactoring of AstroEBSD, a widely used software package.

- **C++** - High-performance linear algebra and fast Fourier transforms implemented, using eigen and fftw packages. Porting functions from MATLAB has resulted in significant speedups (approx. 100 times).

- **Machine learning** - Most experience with PCA, NMF, and neural networks. Unsupservised learning with SKLearn. Neural networks built with PyTorch (both with and without fastai) and MATLAB machine learning toolbox.

- **Computational linear algebra** - I routinely analyse high-dimensionality data, perform orientation analyses, and implement data basis transformations. Experienced with SVD, eigen-decompositions, least-squares solutions.

- **Software development** - Experienced with Github, VSCode, Jupyter Notebooks, etc.

- **Data handling and computation** - Experienced with clustering, factor extraction, and feature ID. Proficient with NumPy / PyTorch for vectorisation, Numba for speedup, and Multiprocessing for parallelisation.

- **Communication & teaching** - I have successfully supervised Masters students, taught undergraduate classes, and disseminated research at conferences to foster collaboration.


Portfolio
------

**[ebspy](https://github.com/tmcaul/ebspy)** - Python analysis of electron diffraction data.
- Created and developed for loading, handling, and cleaning microscopy data.​
- Provides normalisation, background correction, and ML / SKLearn pipelines for characterisation and dataset decomposition.
​

**[AstroEBSD](https://github.com/benjaminbritton/AstroEBSD)** - Crystallograhic and structural analysis .
- Orientation determination, signal clustering, and structure classification with template matching, built in MATLAB.
- Initially developed by the group for Hough transforms and geometrical analysis of diffraction data.
- Recently updated to version 2.0 with my contributions: an open-source PCA pipeline for analysis of correlative, multimodal datasets, including Fourier cross-correlation of simulated templates for orientation and structure ID.

**[crosspy](https://github.com/apexburgers/crosspy)** - Fourier image registration and subset tracking in Python.
- Co-created and developed for loading, handling, and analysing digital images for displacement tracking.​
- Fourier cross-correlation, displacement tracking, object-oriented data loading, and least-squares minimisation of a 2D polynomial basis for out-of-plane distortion correction.
Calculation of strain tensor components from a spatial derivative.
